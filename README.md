# OldCrypt Library
## Introduction
This is a library that contains algorithms for encrypting and decrypting data (text/binary) using mostly old encryption methods.
It's by no means a secure encryption library and was never meant to be. It's primary purpose is education/entertainment.

## License
This library is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3**.

## Few author's words
I've created this library when creating my program [OldCrypt](https://github.com/VojtechKursa/OldCrypt-GUI) and decided to make the cryptographical library separate, so anyone can easily use it within their programs.
I'm not really sure how anyone's gonna use it, but I guess someone somewhere could fancy a good old *Playfair* in their program.

## Building the library
You can build the library by opening either the *.csproj* or *.sln* file using Visual Studio or any equivalent program and building the project.
Alternatively you can download a build from the [releases section of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/VojtechKursa/OldCrypt-Library/releases).
